## Introduction

Mocha is a powerful JavaScript testing framework that simplifies writing tests for your code. Whether you're working on Node.js or browser-based applications, Mocha has you covered. This guide will walk you through setting up Mocha, how it works, and how to get started with automated testing.

## Features

- **Handles Asynchronous Code**: Mocha makes it easy to test asynchronous operations like promises or callbacks.
- **Highly Customizable**: You can modify the test setup to fit different testing environments.
- **Supports Assertion Libraries**: Mocha works well with popular assertion libraries such as Chai.
- **Detailed Test Reports**: Get easy-to-read test reports to quickly spot issues.
- **Cross-Platform**: Mocha works seamlessly across Node.js and browser environments.

## Installation

Hereâ€™s how you can set up Mocha for test automation on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system if you haven't already.

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amaninreal/mocha-framework.git

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd mocha-framework
    npm install

### Configuration

If needed, you can create a .env file for storing environment variables (like base URLs or credentials). For example:
    ```bash
    BASE_URL=https://www.abc.com/

### Running Tests
To run the tests, you can simply execute this command:
    ```bash
    npx mocha test/

To run the tests with a specific reporter for better formatting:
    ```bash
    npx mocha test/ --reporter spec
